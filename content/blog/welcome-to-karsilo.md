# Welcome to Karsilo

We're thrilled to announce the official launch of Karsilo, a revolutionary platform designed to help founders and businesses gain complete visibility into their revenue streams.

## Why We Built Karsilo

Managing multiple Stripe accounts can be overwhelming. Whether you're running several businesses, managing client accounts, or scaling your SaaS operations, keeping track of revenue across different accounts has always been a challenge.

That's why we built Karsilo – to give you a unified dashboard where all your revenue data lives in one place.

## What Makes Karsilo Different

### Unified Dashboard

Connect unlimited Stripe accounts and see all your revenue metrics in a single, beautiful dashboard. No more logging into multiple accounts or manually combining data in spreadsheets.

### Real-Time Analytics

Watch your revenue grow in real-time with live updates. Our dashboard refreshes automatically, giving you the most current view of your business performance.

### Smart Insights

Beyond just showing numbers, Karsilo helps you understand your business better:

- **MRR Tracking**: Monitor your Monthly Recurring Revenue across all accounts
- **Churn Analysis**: Identify at-risk customers before they leave
- **Growth Metrics**: Track your growth rate and predict future revenue

## Getting Started

Getting started with Karsilo is simple:

1. **Sign up** for a free account
2. **Connect** your Stripe accounts with one click
3. **Explore** your unified dashboard

We've designed the onboarding process to take less than 5 minutes, so you can start gaining insights immediately.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We have an exciting roadmap ahead, including:

- Advanced reporting and export features
- Team collaboration tools
- Custom alert notifications
- API access for developers
